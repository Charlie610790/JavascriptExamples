Beginning Javascript

This was my first attempt with Javascript.  This assignment taught me how to assign variables and pull information from arrays of player stats.  I used Javascript to manipulate and alter the returned information from the functions.  I showed that I could use the following Javascript methods on arrays: .split, .length, .slice, .pop, .shift, and .reverse.  Also demonstrated uses of and/or and if/else statements as well as .forEach, .reduce and .map.
